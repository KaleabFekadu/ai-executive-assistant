# Solution Requirements Specification: AI Executive Assistant

## 1. Role and Rationale

**Role**: Executive Assistant in a Tech Startup  
**Rationale**: The executive assistant role in a tech startup involves repetitive, time-consuming tasks such as scheduling meetings, sending follow-up emails, and managing task reminders. Automating these tasks with an AI agent reduces administrative overhead, enabling founders and teams to focus on core business activities. This solution leverages free-tier APIs (Google Calendar, SendGrid, Gemini) to deliver high-value automation without requiring a billing account, aligning with the platform’s goal of enabling individuals and teams to achieve extraordinary outcomes through AI.

## 2. Key Tasks and Workflows

The AI agent automates the following high-impact tasks of an executive assistant:

### 2.1 Scheduling Meetings

- **Description**: Users input natural language commands (e.g., “Schedule a meeting with John next Thursday at 2 PM”) via a web UI. The AI parses the command, checks calendar availability, and creates a meeting event.
- **Workflow**:
  - User submits command through the UI.
  - Gemini API parses the command to extract attendee, date, and time.
  - Google Calendar API checks availability and creates an event.
  - The event is displayed in the UI’s calendar view.
- **Value**: Saves time on manual scheduling and coordination.

### 2.2 Sending Follow-Up Emails

- **Description**: After a meeting, the AI generates and sends professional follow-up emails to attendees.
- **Workflow**:
  - Post-meeting, the AI retrieves meeting details from Google Calendar.
  - Gemini API generates a professional email based on meeting context.
  - SendGrid API sends the email to the attendee.
  - Users can review or trigger emails via the UI.
- **Value**: Automates post-meeting communication, ensuring timely follow-ups.

### 2.3 Managing Task Reminders

- **Description**: Users input tasks with due dates via the UI. The AI stores tasks and sends daily reminders for due tasks.
- **Workflow**:
  - User submits a task (e.g., “Finish report by Friday”) via the UI.
  - Task is stored in Firestore (GCP free tier).
  - Cloud Scheduler triggers a daily job to check for due tasks.
  - SendGrid sends email reminders, and notifications appear in the UI.
- **Value**: Enhances productivity by ensuring tasks are not forgotten.

## 3. Technical Architecture

The solution is a full-stack web application with balanced frontend and backend components, leveraging free-tier services for accessibility.

### 3.1 Frontend

- **Technology**: React.js with Tailwind CSS for a responsive web interface.
- **Components**:
  - **Command Input**: Form for entering natural language commands.
  - **Calendar View**: Displays scheduled meetings using `react-big-calendar`.
  - **Notification Panel**: Shows task reminders and email confirmations.
- **Hosting**: Firebase Hosting (free tier, 10 GB/month).

### 3.2 Backend

- **Technology**: Node.js with Express for API handling.
- **Database**: Firestore (GCP free tier, 1 GB storage) for storing tasks.
- **Endpoints**:
  - `/schedule`: Processes commands to create Google Calendar events.
  - `/email/followup`: Generates and sends follow-up emails.
  - `/tasks`: Stores tasks and triggers reminders.
- **Hosting**: Cloud Run (free tier, 180,000 vCPU-seconds/month).

### 3.3 AI Integration

- **Technology**: Gemini API (free tier, 15 requests/minute, 1,500 requests/day) for natural language processing.
- **Functions**:
  - Parse scheduling commands into structured data (attendee, date, time).
  - Generate professional email content for follow-ups.

### 3.4 Third-Party APIs

- **Google Calendar API** (free tier): Creates and retrieves meeting events.
- **SendGrid API** (free tier, 100 emails/day): Sends follow-up emails and task reminders.

### 3.5 Automation

- **Technology**: Cloud Scheduler (free tier, 3 jobs/month).
- **Function**: Triggers a daily job at 8 AM to check Firestore for due tasks and send reminders via SendGrid.

## 4. User Interaction

- **Web UI**: Users access a responsive web application to:
  - Input natural language commands for scheduling or tasks.
  - View and manage meeting schedules in a calendar interface.
  - Review notifications for reminders and email confirmations.
  - Approve or trigger follow-up emails.
- **Proactive Actions**: The AI automatically sends task reminders and follow-up emails based on schedules and due dates, with notifications displayed in the UI.

## 5. Constraints

- **Free-Tier Limits**:
  - Gemini API: 1,500 requests/day.
  - SendGrid API: 100 emails/day.
  - Firestore: 1 GB storage, 50,000 reads/day, 20,000 writes/day.
  - Cloud Run: 180,000 vCPU-seconds/month.
  - Cloud Scheduler: 3 jobs/month.
  - Firebase Hosting: 10 GB/month.
- **Accessibility**: No billing account or credit card required, using only GCP Always Free Tier and free API tiers.
- **Time**: Built within a 1-day timeframe, prioritizing core functionality (scheduling, emails, reminders) for an MVP.
- **OAuth**: Google Calendar API requires OAuth 2.0 authentication, implemented with a simplified flow for demo purposes.

## 6. Evaluation Criteria Alignment

- **Value Proposition**: The AI agent saves time and reduces costs by automating tasks typically requiring a human assistant, potentially replacing a $50K/year role.
- **Automation Effectiveness**: Handles scheduling, emails, and reminders with minimal user input, rivaling human performance for these tasks.
- **Technical Execution**: Balanced full-stack solution with seamless frontend-backend integration, leveraging free APIs and GCP services.
- **Problem-Solving & Adaptability**: Designed to thrive in ambiguity, with clear prioritization of high-impact tasks and robust error handling.

## 7. Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Integrate additional APIs (e.g., Slack for notifications) if free tiers are available.
- Enhance NLP with Gemini for more complex command parsing.
- Add document organization features if time permits.

This SRS serves as the implementation guide for the AI Executive Assistant, demonstrating technical proficiency, creativity, and alignment with the platform’s vision of AI-driven work transformation.
